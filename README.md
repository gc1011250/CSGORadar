# CSGORadar
For a school project I had to do something with an arduino.
I decided to make a radar for csgo with a led matrix. 


- Supplies -
1) Arduino Uno.
2) 2 Breadboards.
3) 8x8 led matrix.



The connections between the arduino and the led matrix looks something like this.

You will have to update the addresses and offsets in the main.cpp file for it to work.
The addresses can be found here: https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/csgo.cs.
you will probably also have to change the COM port for it to work which is also in the main.cpp file.
